# myFirst_Project
My first project that I wrote when I begin learning C just because of understanding pointer and  NULL
SO I just tried to learn about assigning NULL value to variable address so I tried to understand it nearly one week . When I find answers to my all questions I came to a conclusion to accomplish this fun and little project.
When we change value of any variable in function with it's address after function calling it also affect to value of this variable in main function
In my code I assigned value for example 100 or 400 but when I send it to function that takes variable with it's address(with pointer) as a argument and assigns to it NULL  value.
